Cloud-Multiple-Tiers-Simulation
===============================

Installation
============
After you cloned the project via git, you can work with it in your editor of choice. We propose to use either eclipse or netbeans.
For this project we used netbeans for the GUI, so if you want to change the GUI using netbeans would be a good idea.

Used java sdk: 1.07

Eclipse
==========
From Eclipse choose New Project > New Java Projekt and select the folder where you cloned the project. Note that you have to uncheck the checkbox 'use default location'.
Now you need also to add the dependencies for the project, because we don't use maven/other build tools. To do so, select the project, go to properties > java build path and add all the dependencies form the dependencies folder you just cloned.

Using the simulator
============
To use the simulator just start the Gui.java as a java application.
